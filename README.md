# Unstructured Data Processing
Here is a collection of implementation to derive a structured data set from the unstructured one.  

From Advances in Financial Machine Learning :  
- Sampling dollar bars from time bars
- Extracting relevant samples using the symmetric CUSUM Filter

Ideas for further research
- Sampling dollar bars where the size of the bar is dynamically adjusted as a function of something.
